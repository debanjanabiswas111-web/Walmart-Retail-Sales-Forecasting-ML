# Walmart-Retail-Sales-Forecasting-ML
Machine learning–based retail sales forecasting using regression models, EDA, and feature engineering on Walmart sales data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting retail weekly sales using machine learning techniques. Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory, reduce costs, and improve decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective
To build and compare regression-based machine learning models that forecast weekly retail sales using historical and economic data.

## 📊 Dataset
Walmart Sales Dataset containing:
- Store information
- Holiday indicators
- Temperature
- Fuel price
- CPI
- Unemployment
- Weekly sales (target variable)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook/Visual Studio Code

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Model building and evaluation  

## 🤖 Models Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regression

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🏆 Results
Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression by reducing RMSE and improving predictive accuracy, indicating better handling of non-linear relationships in sales data.

## 💡 Key Insights
- Holiday weeks significantly impact sales
- Economic indicators influence demand patterns
- Ensemble models capture complex sales behavior more effectively

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Time-series forecasting models
- Deployment using Flask or Streamlit
